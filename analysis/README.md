# Analysis

The analysis folder contains two main subfolders:

- `data` initially contains a copy of the raw data from the experiment, but as we create tidier data sets we'll write those to this folder
- `docs` contains the R Markdown documents (i.e., `.Rmd` files) that we'll use to perform and document our data analysis, as well as the nice reports (e.g., `.html` files) that are produced at the end
