```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Getting started

The first thing to do in our analysis is load the R
packages that we'll use to do the work:

```{r packageload, message=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

The next step is to load the data set itself. The data 
from the sampling frames experiment are stored in the 
"frames_ex2.csv" file:

```{r dataimport}
loc <- here("analysis","data","frames_ex2.csv")
frames <- read_csv(file = loc)
```
